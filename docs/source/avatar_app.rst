Avatar applications

Avatar refers to realistic virtual humans that can help people complete "must-attend" tasks in the real world. Avatar applications are used in various fields, such as education, healthcare, and customer service.

1. **Audio**: The avatar should be able to produce realistic voice and sound effects.
2. **Face**: The avatar should have a realistic face with facial expressions and movements.
3. **Body**: The avatar should have a realistic body with movements and gestures.
