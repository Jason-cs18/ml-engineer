LLM applications
================
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various domains. However, building a real-world application with LLMs can be challenging due to their hallucinations and outdated knowledge. To address these issues, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agentic AI have been employed. In this note, we will introduce them and provide a hands-on recipe to build a AI assistant and a AI scientist.
